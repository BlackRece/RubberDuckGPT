# RubberDuckGPT
One of the most helpful tools that a programmer/developer can have is the RubberDuck Debugger. Here is an AI version using ChatGPT to allow the user to describe their code line by line and receive intelligent responses.

When working remotely or any environment where another human is not available, talking to a rubber duck may feel uncomfortable. Having someone that can respond would be helpful, however, if they do not understand the terms and concepts being discussed may hinder the process. Having an application with the ability to intelligently respond without having to constantly go over the basics, helps to concentrate on more complex issues and does not require another human.

In software engineering, rubber duck debugging (or rubberducking) is a method of debugging code by articulating a problem in spoken or written natural language. The name is a reference to a story in the book The Pragmatic Programmer in which a programmer would carry around a rubber duck and debug their code by forcing themselves to explain it, line by line, to the duck.[1] Many other terms exist for this technique, often involving different (usually) inanimate objects, or pets such as a dog or a cat. Teddy bears are also widely used.
